# GIS5572-lab1
Welcome to the GIS5572 Lab One repository! 
This lab focuses on learning essential concepts and techniques in GIS using Python. 
**The lab comprises two main parts:** 
Feature Class Creation and Export: 
In this section, you will learn how to create feature classes for points, lines, and polygons using CSV files with 4 differnt environment. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the CSV file to create feature classes. After creating the feature classes, you will export them as shapefiles (.shp) for further analysis or visualization in GIS software. 
**Data Pipeline and Web Application Development: **
This section focuses on building a data pipeline using PostgreSQL with Python's psycopg2 library. You will create a polygon and connect it to a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2. Additionally, you will develop a Flask web application to display the polygon as a URL, allowing for easy access and visualization. 
**Instructions for Lab:**
Feature Class Creation and Export: Open the provided CSV file containing step-by-step instructions for creating feature classes. Follow the instructions to create feature classes for points, lines, and polygons. Once the feature classes are created, export them as shapefiles (.shp) for further analysis or visualization in GIS software. 
**Data Pipeline and Web Application Development: **
Use the provided Python script to create a polygon and connect it to a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured on your local machine. And you VM instance and SQL instance are turned on. Update the script with your PostgreSQL database credentials and execute it to create the polygon and establish the database connection. 
Flask app was created with mkdir flask_app and navigate into it using cd app.py if you want to change anything run nano app.py then connect it with your database save it the run python3 app.py to get your url rul.Follow the instructions provided in the Flask application file to set up and run the Flask web application. Access the Flask web application URL to view and interact with the polygon visualization.
